# AddressCleaner
I made this in Google Scripts to help speed up the upload process of petition signatures from a google sheet to a mass email platform.  All adresses had been entered in a blank feild with no formatting guidelines and many had originally been handwritten. Some  function for google sheets converts messy user-inputted address data into standard address feilds and confirms adressses using geocoder.  It is written in Google Apps Script bound to a specific sheet but could easily be converted to an add-on for general use on any sheet.
